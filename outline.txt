As the previous speaker mentioned, 
* Programming in Sage is useful: 
(1) finding/disproving conjectures
(2) Computing examples 
(3) creating nice latex/tikz figures quickly (e.g. drawing poset).
* Benefits for contributing to Sage:
(1) you donâ€™t lose your code 
(2) It enables others to build on your work.

1. Create a class for a math object for your personal research use
- example: permutation on [n]
2. Create a parent class for your object.
(When contributing a new combinatorial object to Sage, we follow this structure)
- example: 
.. parent class: collection of all permutations on [n]
.. element class: a permutation on [n]
- example:
.. parent class: collection of all noncrossing partitions of [n]
.. element class: a noncrossing partition of [n]
